# conway [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SamTay/conway.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SamTay/conway)
A terminal interface for playing Conway's Game of Life

This is just a pet project that I thought would be a good exercise in Haskell.
The [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) is a cellular automaton
with simple rules but emergent complexity - a quintessential complex system.
The frontend will leverage [brick](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/brick) (wip)
while the backend is supported by [grid](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/grid).

If this turns out to be cool, I'll write up installation instructions.
